Overview of the code:
We have used A-frame for the image tracking and three.js to overlay the video onto the tracked image. The image to be tracked is converted into a targets.mind file using the below link:

In order to change the video go to the videos folder and replace the video. Code has been written in a way that multiple videos exist and can be picked.

Languages used : HTML and Javascript
